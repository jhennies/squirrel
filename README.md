# squirrel

Python-based library for conversion and processing of 3D EM data.

## Installation via conda

hopefully coming soon:

```
conda create -n squirrel-env squirrel
```

## Usage

The main functions can be used directly after activation of the 
conda environment:

```
conda activate squirrel-env

h5_to_tif -h
mib_to_tif -h
```

The -h flag yields the help output describing functions and parameters
